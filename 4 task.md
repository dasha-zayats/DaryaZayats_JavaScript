# answer to the task

### This sequence of brackets [((())()(())]] is incorrect.

#### Steps to solve the problem:
1. We can see that there are only 3 square brackets only at the beginning and at the end of the sequence. We can remove pair of them and get ((())()(())]
2. After that only one thing we can do is to go from the beginning to the end and if opening bracket has a closing one after it with the same type. We can remove this pair. 

((())()(())] -> (()()(())] -> (()(())] -> ((())] -> (()] -> (]

3. Without knowing the context, it is impossible to solve the problem of incorrect bracket sequence. 

But with in example i can only guess, that the second bracket from the end should be round bracket. E.g. [((())()(()))].
